    "options": {
      "A": "Objectives, curriculum, methods, assessments etc. should be different for different levels.",
      "B": "Same teaching methods but different assessment techniques should be at different levels.",
      "C": "Different teaching methods but same assessment techniques should be at different levels.",
      "D": "Same content should be taught at all levels."
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The statement emphasizes aligning science education with the learner's cognitive development stage. Children at different ages understand and process information differently (as per theories like Piaget's stages of cognitive development). Hence, the objectives, curriculum, methods, and assessments should be designed according to the learner's developmental stage."
